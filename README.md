I separately used the process to test my training processes for the AWS Solutions Architect certification, which I am in the process of preparing for the respective exams.

In this repository you will find three projects which I have been studying and using throughout my work experiences during the preparation and implementation of AWS platform services, in some not so much but in the most relevant ones.

It is divided into three projects.

Mini CRM based on CRM React, which is a GLP project in which I made some separate contributions and which I use as a basis for studying the benefits of non-relational database engines in large architectures such as MongoDB.

The second is a short demo that I prepared for this occasion using the AWS TypeScript CDK Cloud Development Kit, and the third is a deployment set for a cluster in Kubernetes with two nodes and a MySQL RDS service with their respective permission and security options to demonstrate my skills in using AWS resources
